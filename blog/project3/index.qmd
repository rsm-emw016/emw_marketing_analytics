This assignment explores two methods for estimating the MNL model: (1) via Maximum Likelihood, and (2) via a Bayesian approach using a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm. 


## 1. Likelihood for the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) Model

Suppose we have $i=1,\ldots,n$ consumers who each select exactly one product $j$ from a set of $J$ products. The outcome variable is the identity of the product chosen $y_i \in \{1, \ldots, J\}$ or equivalently a vector of $J-1$ zeros and $1$ one, where the $1$ indicates the selected product. For example, if the third product was chosen out of 3 products, then either $y=3$ or $y=(0,0,1)$ depending on how we want to represent it. Suppose also that we have a vector of data on each product $x_j$ (eg, brand, price, etc.). 

We model the consumer's decision as the selection of the product that provides the most utility, and we'll specify the utility function as a linear function of the product characteristics:

$$ U_{ij} = x_j'\beta + \epsilon_{ij} $$

where $\epsilon_{ij}$ is an i.i.d. extreme value error term. 

The choice of the i.i.d. extreme value error term leads to a closed-form expression for the probability that consumer $i$ chooses product $j$:

$$ \mathbb{P}_i(j) = \frac{e^{x_j'\beta}}{\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\beta}} $$

For example, if there are 3 products, the probability that consumer $i$ chooses product 3 is:

$$ \mathbb{P}_i(3) = \frac{e^{x_3'\beta}}{e^{x_1'\beta} + e^{x_2'\beta} + e^{x_3'\beta}} $$

A clever way to write the individual likelihood function for consumer $i$ is the product of the $J$ probabilities, each raised to the power of an indicator variable ($\delta_{ij}$) that indicates the chosen product:

$$ L_i(\beta) = \prod_{j=1}^J \mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\delta_{ij}} = \mathbb{P}_i(1)^{\delta_{i1}} \times \ldots \times \mathbb{P}_i(J)^{\delta_{iJ}}$$

Notice that if the consumer selected product $j=3$, then $\delta_{i3}=1$ while $\delta_{i1}=\delta_{i2}=0$ and the likelihood is:

$$ L_i(\beta) = \mathbb{P}_i(1)^0 \times \mathbb{P}_i(2)^0 \times \mathbb{P}_i(3)^1 = \mathbb{P}_i(3) = \frac{e^{x_3'\beta}}{\sum_{k=1}^3e^{x_k'\beta}} $$

The joint likelihood (across all consumers) is the product of the $n$ individual likelihoods:

$$ L_n(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n L_i(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n \prod_{j=1}^J \mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\delta_{ij}} $$

And the joint log-likelihood function is:

$$ \ell_n(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^J \delta_{ij} \log(\mathbb{P}_i(j)) $$



## 2. Simulate Conjoint Data

We will simulate data from a conjoint experiment about video content streaming services. We elect to simulate 100 respondents, each completing 10 choice tasks, where they choose from three alternatives per task. For simplicity, there is not a "no choice" option; each simulated respondent must select one of the 3 alternatives. 

Each alternative is a hypothetical streaming offer consistent of three attributes: (1) brand is either Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Hulu; (2) ads can either be part of the experience, or it can be ad-free, and (3) price per month ranges from \$4 to \$32 in increments of \$4.

The part-worths (ie, preference weights or beta parameters) for the attribute levels will be 1.0 for Netflix, 0.5 for Amazon Prime (with 0 for Hulu as the reference brand); -0.8 for included adverstisements (0 for ad-free); and -0.1*price so that utility to consumer $i$ for hypothethical streaming service $j$ is 

$$
u_{ij} = (1 \times Netflix_j) + (0.5 \times Prime_j) + (-0.8*Ads_j) - 0.1\times Price_j + \varepsilon_{ij}
$$

where the variables are binary indicators and $\varepsilon$ is Type 1 Extreme Value (ie, Gumble) distributed.

The following code provides the simulation of the conjoint data.

:::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
```{}
#| eval: false

# set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# define attributes
brand <- c("N", "P", "H") # Netflix, Prime, Hulu
ad <- c("Yes", "No")
price <- seq(8, 32, by=4)

# generate all possible profiles
profiles <- expand.grid(
    brand = brand,
    ad = ad,
    price = price
)
m <- nrow(profiles)

# assign part-worth utilities (true parameters)
b_util <- c(N = 1.0, P = 0.5, H = 0)
a_util <- c(Yes = -0.8, No = 0.0)

        # compute deterministic portion of utility
        dat$v <- b_util[dat$brand] + a_util[dat$ad] + p_util(dat$price) |> round(10)
        
        # add Gumbel noise (Type I extreme value)
        dat$e <- -log(-log(runif(n_alts)))
        dat$u <- dat$v + dat$e
        
        # identify chosen alternative
        dat$choice <- as.integer(dat$u == max(dat$u))
        
        # store task
        datlist[[t]] <- dat
    }
    
    # combine all tasks for one respondent
    do.call(rbind, datlist)
}

conjoint_data <- conjoint_data[ , c("resp", "task", "brand", "ad", "price", "choice")]

## 3. Preparing the Data for Estimation

The "hard part" of the MNL likelihood function is organizing the data, as we need to keep track of 3 dimensions (consumer $i$, covariate $k$, and product $j$) instead of the typical 2 dimensions for cross-sectional regression models (consumer $i$ and covariate $k$). The fact that each task for each respondent has the same number of alternatives (3) helps.  In addition, we need to convert the categorical variables for brand and ads into binary variables.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Code"
#| output: false
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('conjoint_data.csv')

# Step 1: Create dummy variables for brand and ad (drop reference level)
df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=["brand", "ad"], drop_first=True)

# Step 2: Define feature matrix X
# Reference: brand_H, ad_No are omitted
X = df_encoded[["brand_N", "brand_P", "ad_Yes", "price"]]

# Step 3: Add intercept manually
X["intercept"] = 1
X = X[["intercept", "brand_N", "brand_P", "ad_Yes", "price"]]  # ensure order

# Step 4: Create outcome vector y (binary: 1 if chosen, 0 otherwise)
y = df_encoded["choice"]

# Step 5: Group metadata (optional but useful for tracking)
groups = df_encoded[["resp", "task"]]

# Preview
X.head(), y.head(), groups.head()

```


## 4. Estimation via Maximum Likelihood

We estimate the model using Maximum Likelihood. First, we define the log-likelihood function based on the MNL specification, then use numerical optimization to find the MLEs. Finally, we use the inverse Hessian to obtain standard errors and construct 95% confidence intervals.

### Log-Likelihood Function
```{python}
#| output: false
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import logsumexp
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('conjoint_data.csv')

df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=["brand", "ad"], drop_first=True)
X = df_encoded[["brand_N", "brand_P", "ad_Yes", "price"]]
X["intercept"] = 1
X = X[["intercept", "brand_N", "brand_P", "ad_Yes", "price"]]  # ensure order
y = df_encoded["choice"]
groups = df_encoded[["resp", "task"]]

# Reshape for 3-alternative tasks
X_np = X.values
y_np = y.values
X_tasks = X_np.reshape((-1, 3, X_np.shape[1]))
y_tasks = y_np.reshape((-1, 3))

def neg_log_likelihood(beta):
    """Negative log-likelihood for MNL."""
    X_tasks = X_tasks.astype(np.float64)
    beta = np.asarray(beta, dtype=np.float64)
    utilities = np.einsum("tjk,k->tj", X_tasks, beta)
    log_probs = utilities - logsumexp(utilities, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    chosen_log_probs = np.sum(log_probs * y_tasks, axis=1)
    return -np.sum(chosen_log_probs)
```

### Optimization and Estimation Results
```{python}
#| output: false
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.special import logsumexp
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from numpy.linalg import inv

df = pd.read_csv("conjoint_data.csv")
df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=["brand", "ad"], drop_first=True)
X = df_encoded[["brand_N", "brand_P", "ad_Yes", "price"]].copy()
X["intercept"] = 1
X = X[["intercept", "brand_N", "brand_P", "ad_Yes", "price"]]
y = df_encoded["choice"]
X_np = X.values.astype(np.float64)
y_np = y.values.astype(np.float64)
X_tasks = X_np.reshape((-1, 3, X_np.shape[1]))
y_tasks = y_np.reshape((-1, 3))

def neg_log_likelihood(beta):
    utilities = np.einsum("tjk,k->tj", X_tasks, beta)
    log_probs = utilities - logsumexp(utilities, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    chosen_log_probs = np.sum(log_probs * y_tasks, axis=1)
    return -np.sum(chosen_log_probs)
result = minimize(
    fun=neg_log_likelihood,
    x0=np.zeros(X_np.shape[1]),
    method="BFGS"
)

beta_hat = result.x
hessian_inv = result.hess_inv
std_err = np.sqrt(np.diag(hessian_inv))
z = 1.96
ci_lower = beta_hat - z * std_err
ci_upper = beta_hat + z * std_err

param_names = ["Intercept", "Netflix", "Prime", "Ad", "Price"]
results_df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Estimate": beta_hat,
    "Std. Error": std_err,
    "95% CI Lower": ci_lower,
    "95% CI Upper": ci_upper
}, index=param_names).round(4)
```

The table below summarizes the estimated coefficients from the MNL model, along with standard errors and 95% confidence intervals.

| Variable   | Estimate | Std. Error | 95% CI Lower | 95% CI Upper |
|------------|----------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| Intercept  | 0.0000   | 1.0000     | -1.9600       | 1.9600        |
| Netflix    | 0.9412   | 0.1181     | 0.7097        | 1.1727        |
| Prime      | 0.5016   | 0.1207     | 0.2651        | 0.7382        |
| Ad         | -0.7320  | 0.0893     | -0.9071       | -0.5569       |
| Price      | -0.0995  | 0.0063     | -0.1119       | -0.0871       |

The results indicate strong preferences for Netflix and Prime (relative to Hulu), a penalty for ads, and a negative effect of price. All coefficients are statistically significant except for the intercept.

## 5. Estimation via Bayesian Methods

_todo: code up a metropolis-hasting MCMC sampler of the posterior distribution. Take 11,000 steps and throw away the first 1,000, retaining the subsequent 10,000._

_hint: Use N(0,5) priors for the betas on the binary variables, and a N(0,1) prior for the price beta._

_hint: instead of calculating post=lik*prior, you can work in the log-space and calculate log-post = log-lik + log-prior (this should enable you to re-use your log-likelihood function from the MLE section just above)_

_hint: King Markov (in the video) use a candidate distribution of a coin flip to decide whether to move left or right among his islands.  Unlike King Markov, we have 4 dimensions (because we have 4 betas) and our dimensions are continuous.  So, use a multivariate normal distribution to pospose the next location for the algorithm to move to. I recommend a MNV(mu, Sigma) where mu=c(0,0,0,0) and sigma has diagonal values c(0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.005) and zeros on the off-diagonal.  Since this MVN has no covariances, you can sample each dimension independently (so 4 univariate normals instead of 1 multivariate normal), where the first 3 univariate normals are N(0,0.05) and the last one if N(0,0.005)._


_todo: for at least one of the 4 parameters, show the trace plot of the algorithm, as well as the histogram of the posterior distribution._

_todo: report the 4 posterior means, standard deviations, and 95% credible intervals and compare them to your results from the Maximum Likelihood approach._



## 6. Discussion

_todo: Suppose you did not simulate the data. What do you observe about the parameter estimates? What does $\beta_\text{Netflix} > \beta_\text{Prime}$ mean? Does it make sense that $\beta_\text{price}$ is negative?_

_todo: At a high level, discuss what change you would need to make in order to simulate data from --- and estimate the parameters of --- a multi-level (aka random-parameter or hierarchical) model. This is the model we use to analyze "real world" conjoint data._
